# Nooro Weather Test

By Joey Nash

## Description

This is a simple weather-fetching app. Tapping a search result saves it to UserDefaults, and will show current weather for that city on the next launch

## Getting Started

This app runs on its own for the most part. There is only one thing to worry about, and that is APIKey

## Help

If the app won't search, it's likely the free API Key expired. Get a new key and place it in `Info.plist` under `APIKey`
